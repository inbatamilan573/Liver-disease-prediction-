# Liver-disease-prediction-
As a machine learning enthusiast, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project focused on liver disease prediction. Leveraging my skills in data analysis and machine learning, I was able to develop an innovative algorithm that can accurately predict the likelihood of a patient having liver disease.

During the project, I collected and processed a large amount of patient data, including clinical records, demographic information, and laboratory test results. Using this data, I trained and tested a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful and widely-used technique for classification and prediction tasks.

I worked closely with a term of healthcare terminology to ensure that our model was accurate, and reliable, and could provide valuable insights to help prevent and manage liver diseases. By fine-tuning our algorithm and selecting the most relevant features, we achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 85% in predicting liver diseases.

This project not only helped me develop my skills in data analysis and machine learning but also allowed me to make a positive impact in the healthcare field. By providing accurate and reliable predictions, our model has the potential to help healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients and provide early interventions to prevent the development of liver diseases.
